Skycatch Validation engineer Test

Part 1 : PID Simulator

Build instructions :
1. Navigate to 'Skycatch/PIDControl'
2. Execute 'make' from the terminal. 
3. This should generate a library file called 'libPIDControl.a'
4. pidcontrol.cpp contains documentation about each function and its usage.
5. The plant model for part 2 is also built within this folder. Modification requires rebuilding the project. 


Part 2 :
1. Navigate to the 'Skycatch/Demo/'
2. Execute 'make' from the terminal.
3. This will generate the 'Demo' executable.
4. This needs to be executed from the commandline using './Demo'.
5. Upon execution you will be prompted to enter the duration(number of iterations) of simulation.
6. There is a provision to utilize system time for simulation - but it has been commented out because it does not provide consistent results.


IP Packet Analysis:
1. Navigate to 'Skycatch/PacketAna/'
2. Execute 'make' from the terminal.
3. This should generate an executable 'IPAnalyser'.
4. Execute the program by running './IPanalyser' from the terminal.
5. It will auto execute some test cases.
6. Add custom test cases in the similar fashion as shown in 'main.c'


**Ignore the '.pro' & '.pro.user' files - These have been left for the option to import the projects into 'Qt Creator' for better walkthrough and visualization of the code.
